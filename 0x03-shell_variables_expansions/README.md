# 0x03. Shell, init files, variables and expansions

## Description

This project explores shell initialization files, environment variables, local variables, and various types of shell expansions in Linux. It provides hands-on experience creating and managing variables, modifying the shell environment, and using expansions for dynamic scripting.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain the following without the help of Google:

- What happens when you type `$ ls -l *.txt`
- What are shell initialization files and how to use them
- How to create, update, and delete shell variables
- What are the difference between local and global variables
- What are the types of expansions (e.g., pathname, arithmetic, command)
- How to use shell arithmetic
- How to customize the prompt

## Project Structure

Each script in this directory addresses a specific shell concept. Scripts are named by task number and are exactly two lines long, starting with `#!/bin/bash`.

Example:
- `0-alias`: Creates an alias
- `1-hello_you`: Prints a greeting using the current user
- `2-path`: Adds a directory to the `PATH` variable

## Requirements

- All scripts must be executable and start with `#!/bin/bash`
- Each file must be exactly 2 lines long
- Files should end with a new line
