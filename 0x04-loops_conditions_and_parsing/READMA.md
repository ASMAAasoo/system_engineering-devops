# 0x04 Loops, Conditions and Parsing

This directory contains Bash scripts that demonstrate the use of loops, conditional statements, and basic input parsing. The tasks are designed to help learners practice automation of repetitive tasks, decision making, and handling input data in shell scripting.

## Project Overview

- Use of `for`, `while`, and `until` loops (this project focuses on `for` loops).
- Usage of `if`, `elif`, and `else` conditional statements.
- Parsing and processing of input and environment variables.
- Creating scripts that are clear, concise, and functional.
- All scripts start with the shebang `#!/usr/bin/env bash` or `#!/bin/bash` as specified.
