# Find the Process ID (PID) of the '4-to_infinity_and_beyond' script.

# This ensures we target the specific script rather than just a 'bash' process.

    # By default, 'kill' sends the SIGTERM signal (15), which is a polite request
    # for the process to shut down, allowing it to perform cleanup operations.
