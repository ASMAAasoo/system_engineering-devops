#!/usr/bin/env bash
# A Bash script that forcefully kills the 7-highlander process.

# Use 'pkill' with the '-9' option to send the SIGKILL signal (signal number 9).
# SIGKILL is an unblockable and uncatchable signal that immediately terminates
# the target process, without allowing it to perform any cleanup.
# The '-f' option ensures that the full command line is matched,
# specifically targeting the '7-highlander' script.
pkill -9 -f "7-highlander"
