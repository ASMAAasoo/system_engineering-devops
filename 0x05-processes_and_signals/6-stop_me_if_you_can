#!/usr/bin/env bash
# A Bash script that stops the 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process without using kill or killall.

# Use 'pkill' to send a termination signal to the process whose command line
# matches '4-to_infinity_and_beyond'.
# 'pkill' by default sends SIGTERM (signal 15), which is a polite request to terminate.
# The '-f' option allows matching against the full command line, not just the process name.
pkill -f "4-to_infinity_and_beyond"
